# gapi
Generic API - PHP

# Idea

1. Create a standard REST API that can connect to any table in the database
2. Make the API Configutrable so through configuration the list of tables can be set, and the fields that can be seen, updated, deleted
3. Add Call backs for Pre/POST functionality (Allows additional security)
4. Auto Documnet the API with the correct Call
5. Modify Get to include Sorting and Paging
6. Add a Search option that does standard get with parameters. (Can be Post of Get)

# Demos

Create Demo database and Demo config
Create example Javascript files to demo the API

# Future

1. Allow calls to load child objects as Collections within the JSON
2. Respond with XML instead of JSON
3. ? Convert to a class so that Callbacks are created as child object functions ?
